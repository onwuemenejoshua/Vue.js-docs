description: This page provides an overview of routing in web applications, specifically contrasting client-side routing used in Single-Page Applications (SPAs) with traditional server-side routing

## Client-Side vs. Server-Side Routing​

Routing on the server side means the server is sending a response based on the URL path that the user is visiting. When we click on a link in a traditional server-rendered web app, the browser receives an HTML response from the server and reloads the entire page with the new HTML.

In a <span class="custom-link">[Single-Page Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)</span> (SPA), however, the client-side JavaScript can intercept the navigation, dynamically fetch new data, and update the current page without full page reloads. This typically results in a more snappy user experience, especially for use cases that are more like actual "applications", where the user is expected to perform many interactions over a long period of time.

In such SPAs, the "routing" is done on the client side, in the browser. A client-side router is responsible for managing the application's rendered view using browser APIs such as <span class="custom-link">[History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)</span> or the <span class="custom-link">[`hashchange` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/hashchange_event)</span>.

## Official Router​

Vue is well-suited for building SPAs. For most SPAs, it's recommended to use the officially-supported <snap class="custom-link">[Vue Router library](https://github.com/vuejs/router)</snap>. For more details, see Vue Router's <snap class="custom-link">[documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/)</snap>.

## Simple Routing from Scratch​

If you only need very simple routing and do not wish to involve a full-featured router library, you can do so with <snap class="custom-link">[Dynamic Components](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html#dynamic-components)</snap> and update the current component state by listening to browser <snap class="custom-link">[`hashchange` events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/hashchange_event)</snap> or using the <snap class="custom-link">[History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History)</snap>.

Here's a bare-bone example:

```vue
<script>
import Home from "./Home.vue";
import About from "./About.vue";
import NotFound from "./NotFound.vue";

const routes = {
  "/": Home,
  "/about": About,
};

export default {
  data() {
    return {
      currentPath: window.location.hash,
    };
  },
  computed: {
    currentView() {
      return routes[this.currentPath.slice(1) || "/"] || NotFound;
    },
  },
  mounted() {
    window.addEventListener("hashchange", () => {
      this.currentPath = window.location.hash;
    });
  },
};
</script>

<template>
  <a href="#/">Home</a> | <a href="#/about">About</a> |
  <a href="#/non-existent-path">Broken Link</a>
  <component :is="currentView" />
</template>
```
