## Development vs. Production​

During development, Vue provides a number of features to improve the development experience:

* Warning for common errors and pitfalls
* Props / events validation
* <span class="custom-link">[Reactivity debugging hooks](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-in-depth.html#reactivity-debugging)</span>
* Devtools integration

However, these features become useless in production. Some of the warning checks can also incur a small amount of performance overhead. When deploying to production, we should drop all the unused, development-only code branches for smaller payload size and better performance.


## Without Build Tools​

If you are using Vue without a build tool by loading it from a CDN or self-hosted script, make sure to use the production build (dist files that end in `.prod.js`) when deploying to production. Production builds are pre-minified with all development-only code branches removed.

* If using global build (accessing via the `Vue` global): use `vue.global.prod.js`.
* If using ESM build (accessing via native ESM imports): use `vue.esm-browser.prod.js`.

Consult the <span class="custom-link">[dist file guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/vue#which-dist-file-to-use)</span> for more details.


## With Build Tools​

Projects scaffolded via `create-vue` (based on Vite) or Vue CLI (based on webpack) are pre-configured for production builds.

If using a custom setup, make sure that:

1. `vue` resolves to `vue.runtime.esm-bundler.js`.
2. The compile time feature flags are properly configured.
3. `process.env.NODE_ENV` is replaced with `"production"` during build.

## Tracking Runtime Errors​

The <span class="custom-link">[app-level error handler](https://vuejs.org/api/application.html#app-config-errorhandler)</span> can be used to report errors to tracking services:


```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const app = createApp(...)

app.config.errorHandler = (err, instance, info) => {
  // report error to tracking services
}
```

Services such as <span class="custom-link">[Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/)</span> and <span class="custom-link">[Bugsnag](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/javascript/vue/)</span> also provide official integrations for Vue.
